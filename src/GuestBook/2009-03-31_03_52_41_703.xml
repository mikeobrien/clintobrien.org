  <comments>I didn't know Clinton much but the few memories I have of him will stay with me forever.  I talked to him recently and he gave me a very compelling perspective of the importance of priorities in life.  I will certainly remember this conversation and remember it in everything I do.  

I will be updating my Relay page to be in memory of my uncle Clinton.
