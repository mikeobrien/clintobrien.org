  <comments>I am so sorry for your loss. I know Clinton was a very special person in your life whom you will continue to miss forever. It is beautiful that you have such vivid and special memories of your times with him as a baby, a child, and an adult. Hold onto them! His spirit will live on forever. Keep the memory of him close to your heart.</comments>
