  <comments>I had just retired from doing end-of-life care when my friend/little brother Clinton was diagnosed with Lymphoma. It was a given that I would be his aid through his 3 kinds of Chemo, 4 surgeries, 1 round of radiation, countless doctors appointments, ER visits and hospitalizations.
When we face such a crisis, it is our inner core that comes to the fore. No matter what were our triumphs, mistakes, regrets, or blessings in the rest of our life, it is what we are really made of inside that shines through and gets us through.
Clinton had a beautiful, beautiful core.</comments>
