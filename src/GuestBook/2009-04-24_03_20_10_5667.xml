  <comments>Marguerite dear,

What you wrote about your brother Clinton is beautiful.  I can see the love you had for each other in your words and your many happy memories.  

I only wish I'd known him.  But, after reading all the posts from you and so many people that were lovingly affected by Clinton, I feel I do know him.

He was so young in age, but wise in the way of loving God through neighbor.  His wish came true when you arrived by his bedside to exchange comforting words and touches with each other before he bid us all -"Goodbye for now - til we meet again".

May God rest his soul.   Anne
