  <comments>When I came to NOW Foods 10 years ago- Clint was one of the 1st guys I met.
Clint was very- very helpful to me.  He helped explain the company to me, he helped motivate and lead me in the direction I needed to go to be succesful. 
Clint was always a bundle of laughs, very creative, always very thoughtful and giving.
I can still see him walking around, handing out flowers to all the other co workers who helped him out.
He was very giving and appreciative of all those who helped him.
He left his mark, and we will always smile when we think about him!

God Bless his soul!
