  <comments>Dear cousins, I'm sorry for your loss, .... although I never knew Clint personally. I also maintain a Haggerty Family History website which includes Clint who is a member &amp;amp; which includes all of the Haggerty history as I understand it at the moment. I plan to include all of the Clint "obit" data there. If you wish to contribute to or peruse the history, drop me a note at the above location, all are welcome. ..... Ed
