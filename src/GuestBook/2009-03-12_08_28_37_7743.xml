  <comments>Clinton was a great brother growing up, we had lots of good times together.He was always smiling and had a good heart. In the last 8 months I have grown closer to the man Clinton had become and am sad that I had missed the 30+ yrs in between. All I can say is don't let time go by without forgiveness and understanding. Life is a gift and never take it lightly. Clinton you will be missed and I will always remember our late night chats. See you soon one day my Brother , Your sis, Ellen Lee 386-479-0438, Amber and Michael please give us a call</comments>
