  <comments>Clint has been my friend for probably 15 years. We roomed together at a company convention. We worked together over the years, we went with different companies over the years. We have always stayed in touch and we have always been friends. 

I will miss Clint and his laugh, he was a joy and a blessing to be around. I look forward to the time that I see my friend in heaven one day. I know that all of you in the family and all of his friends will miss him. I will keep each and everyone in prayer that our LORD will give you strength. Please know he is now at the side of our LORD and is inside of Heavens Gates. Thank you Clint for being my friend. 
God's Blessings.
