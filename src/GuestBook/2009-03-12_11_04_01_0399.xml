  <comments>Although we only knew Clinton for a short time ( a little over a year) he had a big impact on our lives.  He expanded our little universe with his kindness, sense of humor, and loving attention. He became a good friend and spiritual brother.

Clinton had a sense of humor that he used often to make people laugh and was quick to catch on when someone else made a joke.  We thoroughly enjoyed his company. 

Clinton especially loved to have deep spiritual discussions and was well versed in the scriptures. 

We are so very deeply sad that he died.  Clinton knew that we loved him and we knew that he loved us (and our dog Rufus). He spoke often of his children and we knew that he loved them very much. We expect to see Clinton in the resurrection and look forward to seeing him again.</comments>
