  <comments>I knew Clint over the last four years.  Clint was a friend that you could talk to anytime and he would make time for you.  We had a lot of good laughs and a lot of great conversations.  I was aware when Clint got sick and the hardships he went through but even then he never seemed to be in a bad mood.  I was really sorry to hear of his passing. Clint, I will miss my friend.</comments>
