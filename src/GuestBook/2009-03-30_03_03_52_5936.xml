  <comments>I met Clint at NOW Foods about 10 years ago and I will never forget him. I remember Clint at the office as being very energetic and always happy! 

I also worked with Clint a little bit outside of NOW Foods teaching English to a family who needed help.  Clint was always doing something to make life a little better for someone else.  

May the grace and peace of Jesus be upon the family. </comments>
