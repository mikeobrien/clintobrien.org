<p>Clinton loved many things; travel, the outdoors, camping, cooking, meeting new people and helping others to learn about the Bible. He has been described as positive, gregarious, zealous, a hard worker, concerned about others, giving and passionate about life. He was known for making "big, incredible meals" and bringing people together socially, especially those who needed encouragement. He was one who was not held back by obstacles. Even in the last stages of his illness he still zealously shared in the public ministry and cooked those "big" meals for his friends. </p> 
 
<p>Of greatest importance in his life was his dedication to God. He was baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses in October 1978. He was very zealous in telling others about his faith and sharing the hope held out in the Bible (<a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/bible/2pe/chapter_003.htm#bk13">2 Peter 3:13</a>, <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/bible/re/chapter_021.htm#bk3">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>). Although he had a strong desire to live, he had faith that the promise of a resurrection, held out in the Bible, would come true (<a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/bible/joh/chapter_005.htm#bk28">John 5:28, 29</a>, <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/bible/ac/chapter_024.htm#bk15">Acts 24:15</a>, <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/bible/re/chapter_020.htm#bk13">Rev. 20:13, 14</a>). </p>
